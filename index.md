# PowerAPI: A Community Specification for Power Monitoring and Control

The Power API is a community-lead specification for an power monitoring and control API that supports small scale to extreme-scale systems.

Version 1.0 of the specification is available here: [Community Specification Version 1.0](https://pwrapi.githu.io/files/powerapi_v10.pdf)

The Power API is associated with the Energy Efficient High Performance Working Group effort. You can find the EEHPCWG website at: <https://eehpcwg.llnl.gov"> 

An overview of the API and its reference implementation was published in IEEE Computer magazine in October 2016 entitled Standardizing Power Monitoring and Control at Exascale.
